      <description>There has been a trend over the last 5-10 years, where more and more money is being thrown at startups who claim (mistakenly) to be making software developers obsolete by use of AI. Of course, as a rule - generalizations are never accurate. However, in this case it&amp;rsquo;s a bit funny to watch certain valley tech incubators and fund houses keep throwing good money in this area.
IMO software developers being obsolete or sentient AI writing code is just a black hole.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scratch.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;scratch&lt;/a&gt; today. I wrote a trivial program with it - A plane falling down on an unassuming unaware kitty, with sound effects of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
