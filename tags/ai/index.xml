      <description>There has been a trend over the last 5-10 years, where more and more money is being thrown at startups who claim (mistakenly) to be making software developers obsolete by use of AI. Of course, as a rule - generalizations are never accurate. However, in this case it&amp;rsquo;s a bit funny to watch certain valley tech incubators and fund houses keep throwing good money in this area.
IMO software developers being obsolete or sentient AI writing code is just a black hole.</description>
