      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strawberries and Cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, that was what I felt like having today; that very english summer delicacy. But alas, neither do we have strawberries lying around nor cream. Driven by my desire to sample this delectable delicacy (and not finding it close at hand), I ended up searching (yes, yes – google search – the bane of this generation and others to come) for it; and voila, stumbled upon some prose – the kind of which we don’t come across anymore.
