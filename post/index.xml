      <description>Ah, so we&amp;rsquo;re back again. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can cover some distance this time.
In the last post, we went with an overview of congestion control in networks. In this post, lets take a look at some of the concepts mentioned in the previous post and some new ones to aid our understanding of this subject.
Modeling Networks While modeling networks in order to figure out strategies to combat congestion, one question almost always pops up.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I picked up the proverbial pen to jot down my ramblings. The usual trappings of work and life have encumbered me. But then again, the curious mind just needs to take a liking to something for the muse to strike. So here I am; digging into TCP congestion control mechanisms &amp;amp; the underlying algorithms.
&amp;lsquo;cause, heck; why not!
Networks are fascinating things; Links and network elements working together to ferry bytes from point A to point B.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you work with docker containers, you would have noticed the quirky names that docker generates for your containers. Ever wondered how they are generated? Let me unravel this mystery for you today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scratch.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;scratch&lt;/a&gt; today. I wrote a trivial program with it - A plane falling down on an unassuming unaware kitty, with sound effects of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Picking a code editor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a programmer, it would&amp;rsquo;nt be an exaggeration to say that at least half of your life is spent within an editor. You are in your element within the editor. It&amp;rsquo;s the programmer&amp;rsquo;s domain where he/she creates something out of nothing, in a manner of speaking. Given this, it is really really important for a programmer to be the master of the editor he/she works with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strawberries and Cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, that was what I felt like having today; that very english summer delicacy. But alas, neither do we have strawberries lying around nor cream. Driven by my desire to sample this delectable delicacy (and not finding it close at hand), I ended up searching (yes, yes – google search – the bane of this generation and others to come) for it; and voila, stumbled upon some prose – the kind of which we don’t come across anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific American’s latest 60 seconds science podcast concerns the broken windows theory which states that “in a neighborhood where buildings have broken windows, people are more likely to engage in bad behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
