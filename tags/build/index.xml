      <description>As the first week at the new gig draws to a close, the total absurdity (in a very good way) of the development, build &amp;amp; deploy systems here just blows my mind. If I had to choose just one of those, I would choose the build system.
I do not know if this is something I know enough about to discuss at this time or if that&amp;rsquo;s even allowed (you know NDA and such), but I can say for sure that the immense amount of engineer time &amp;amp; productivity lost in my last gig could have been salvaged - if only we had spent enough time thinking about &amp;amp; working on reducing the build times over the years, instead of sitting on our haunches, patting our backs &amp;amp; basking in the light of past laurels ðŸ˜ž</description>
