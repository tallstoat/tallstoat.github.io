      <description>Latest Threat Horizons report from Google Cloud is out!
Insights These are a few insights from it.
57.4% Cloud Compromises are due to weak or no credentials You&amp;rsquo;ve got to be kidding me! It&amp;rsquo;s 2022 for Pete&amp;rsquo;s sake!
At least use STRONG password and MFA, if nothing else!
65% of Compromises are used for Crypto Mining A bit surprising but it is what it is. SSH, WordPress, and RDP are most targeted Not surprized at all!</description>

      <description>As the first week at the new gig draws to a close, the total absurdity (in a very good way) of the development, build &amp;amp; deploy system here just blows my mind.
I do not know if this is something I know enough about to discuss at this time or if that&amp;rsquo;s even allowed (you know NDA and such), but I can say for sure that the immense amount of engineer time &amp;amp; productivity lost in my last gig could have been salvaged - if only we had spent enough time thinking about &amp;amp; working on reducing the build &amp;amp; deploy times over the years, instead of sitting on our haunches, patting our backs &amp;amp; basking in the light of past laurels 😞</description>

      <description>As seasons change and years pass, this old brain needs to learn new tricks to satiate it&amp;rsquo;s unending craving for solving ambiguous and hard problems.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s time to feed it the next set of problem fodder, so to speak; with an interesting &amp;lsquo;domain centric&amp;rsquo; pivot.
Here&amp;rsquo;s raising one to jumping into the unknown 😉</description>

      <title>TCP Congestion Control III: BBR</title>

      <description>In the first post in this series, we went with an overview of congestion control in networks (primarily to whet your appetite). Then, in the second post, we explored some of the basic concepts underpinning most of the loss-based congestion control algorithms.
Now though instead of going over Reno, Tahoe or CUBIC which frankly are covered quite a bit elsewhere; in this post, lets take a look at BBR. It&amp;rsquo;s the new unruly kid on the block; who dare I say, plays a bit rough in the yard!</description>

      <description>Ah, so we&amp;rsquo;re back again. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can cover some distance this time.
In the last post, we went with an overview of congestion control in networks. In this post, lets take a look at some of the concepts mentioned in the previous post and some new ones to aid our understanding of this subject.
Modeling Networks While modeling networks in order to figure out strategies to combat congestion, one question almost always pops up.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I picked up the proverbial pen to jot down my ramblings. The usual trappings of work and life have encumbered me. But then again, the curious mind just needs to take a liking to something for the muse to strike. So here I am; digging into TCP congestion control mechanisms &amp;amp; the underlying algorithms.
&amp;lsquo;cause, heck; why not!
Networks are fascinating things; Links and network elements working together to ferry bytes from point A to point B.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you work with docker containers, you would have noticed the quirky names that docker generates for your containers. Ever wondered how they are generated? Let me unravel this mystery for you today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Picking a code editor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a programmer, it would&amp;rsquo;nt be an exaggeration to say that at least half of your life is spent within an editor. You are in your element within the editor. It&amp;rsquo;s the programmer&amp;rsquo;s domain where he/she creates something out of nothing, in a manner of speaking. Given this, it is really really important for a programmer to be the master of the editor he/she works with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strawberries and Cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, that was what I felt like having today; that very english summer delicacy. But alas, neither do we have strawberries lying around nor cream. Driven by my desire to sample this delectable delicacy (and not finding it close at hand), I ended up searching (yes, yes – google search – the bane of this generation and others to come) for it; and voila, stumbled upon some prose – the kind of which we don’t come across anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific American’s latest 60 seconds science podcast concerns the broken windows theory which states that “in a neighborhood where buildings have broken windows, people are more likely to engage in bad behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
